        "summary": "Youth culture meets identity politics in this part-thriller, part-gay love story set in London in 1977, days before the Queen's Silver Jubilee celebrations. The hedonistic world of pirate DJs Chris and Caz is shattered when a close friend is killed while cruising in the local park. The black community suspect the National Front, but the police pull Chris in as a suspect. This beautifully crafted period piece, a bold and stylish debut feature from Isaac Julien, paints a convincing picture of late-'70s London. The city is a carefully mapped out social landscape, open to all but offering safety to none, as we are taken to a Dalston barber, east London council estates festooned with Union Jacks, West End offices, soul clubs and city parks.",

        "summary": "Carole Taylor is a party girl, a solo mother of meagre means trying to mend her ways and make a secure home for her two young children. But her past, in the person of former boyfriend Tony Michaels is threatening to shatter the security of the fragile world she has built. Carole has given Tony the push but he refuses to take no for an answer and keeps coming back. Carole tells herself she has the situation under control, but then he turns up at her home in the early hours one morning in blood soaked clothes and everything changes. Drug importer Alan Sheridan has been brutally murdered and Detective Inspector Andrew Hunter has Tony and his associate Freddie Prichard in centre frame for the crime. But in 1985 Auckland, police investigation is a laborious time-consuming process. This is a world before DNA profiling, personal computers and mobile phones. The only evidence Hunter has to nail his old foe Tony Michaels is a missing CCTV tape and two witnesses - Carole Taylor and her eight-year-old daughter Rosie. Against her will Carole and her children are taken into hiding by three unlikely policemen a tired veteran counting down to retirement, a gullible rookie and a would-be predator. Witness protection is in its infancy in New Zealand in 1985, and the officers charged with the Taylor familys security are under resourced, inexperienced and ill-prepared for the double threat they face. Tony Michaels is recklessly committed to finding and destroying the evidence against him the video tape recording his crime and the witnesses, Carole and her kids. By the same token Inspector Hunter is prepared to use whatever methods, legal or otherwise to ruthlessly bring Michaels to justice. Even it means using Carole, her kids and his own officers as bait. Holed up in a dilapidated bungalow, strangers in a rural town are difficult to hide. Trapped inside the house for weeks on end, cabin fever sets in, personalities clash, the situation begins to unravel. A solo mother with children by different fathers, a known associate of a drug dealing murder, Carole is not held in high regard by the cops charged with her safety and when she tries to leave her resentful protectors become jailers. Impatient for a result Inspector Hunter raises the stakes. Knowing that her cover is blown he withdraws the police detail leaving Carole to fend for herself. With no money, no phone, no-one to turn to Carole finally comes to realise that one thing that would destroy them is in the house with her and her kids. Paul, her nine-year-old son has unwittingly carried with him the evidence they all seek. He has retrieved and concealed the CCTV tape of Sheridans murder and now Michaels is coming to get it. With no-one to stand in his way what will become of her? Victim or survivor? Carole has nothing to rely upon but her own determination to protect her children at whatever cost to her own safety. SAFE HOUSE is the story of a struggle for survival in an unfamiliar and threatening world. It is based on the terrifying ordeal of one woman and her children in the early days of the witness protection programme in New Zealand. \u2014Craig",

        "summary": "It's the late nineteenth century US. When he was a boy in the Wyoming Territory, John William Goodnight was on a covered wagon that passed as the local stagecoach in the area with his farmer parents and Judge Aldous Shaw and his wife Rebecca Shaw, who the Goodnights had only just met before the start of their travels from what was then a town called Dry Gulch, which has now been renamed Crooked Stick. Targeting Judge Shaw who had just convicted their partner, bandits attacked the wagon, killing all on board except John and Mrs. Shaw, who ended up raising John as her own. A Chicago lawyer who believes in the law but not in lawyers, John, who lives hard and according to Rebecca should long ago have been dead because of it, has just been appointed by the Governor of Illinois as a circuit court judge for the Wyoming Territory, known as the most lawless region on the continent. Rebecca is the one who arranged this appointment, as she feels that John's recklessness is due to still being that tortured little boy who saw his parents killed, and that his restlessness will never cease without that one living bandit who killed his parents facing justice. Living by Rebecca's code, John strives for justice and not revenge though the law. In-between trying the cases brought before him in Wyoming, John tries to discover the happenings of that bandit that killed his parents and Rebecca's husband, he who was masked during the attack but who walks with a limp. When John reaches Crooked Stick on his travels, he finds that the town is run by a man named Dan Reed, who is able to do so because of his wealth. Dan operates by his own rules, which is all for himself, and damned anyone who is against him, including the law. Dan is not averse to murder to get what he wants. John is fairly certain that Dan is the bandit that he is looking for. He may be able to prove it with the help of a widowed local named Dr. Kate Ramsey, a woman who he is falling for, but proof may be a moot point if Dan and his men kill him and Kate first. John, however, may find that all is not as it first appears on the surface. \u2014Huggo",

        "summary": "What if confronting the climate crisis is the best chance we'll ever get to build a better world? Filmed over 211 shoot days in nine countries and five continents over four years, This Changes Everything is an epic attempt to re-imagine the vast challenge of climate change. The film presents seven portraits of communities on the front lines, from Montana's Powder River Basin to the Alberta Tar Sands, from the coast of South India to Beijing and beyond. Interwoven with these stories of struggle is Naomi Klein's narration, connecting the carbon in the air with the economic system that put it there. Throughout the film, Klein builds to her most controversial and exciting idea: that we can seize the existential crisis of climate change to transform our failed economic system into something radically better. \u2014Production",
